*By jove! What a weird name!*

This is a "jupiter-compatible" set of packages and configurations for NixOS.

[There's a disambiguation page that won't help you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(disambiguation)).

I'm not really sure. I don't know *exactly* what it's the codename for. It is
either the codename for the Steam Deck, or the codename for the new Steam OS
for the Steam Deck. Things get awfully murky when you realize that *Neptune*'s
also a thing, and it's unclear really from the outside, and quick searches
don't provide *conclusive* evidence. But to the best of my knowledge, Jupiter
is the OS for us.

> So it's a NixOS configuration that gives me the Steam Deck user experience?

No.

> But... Uh, what?

It might become. For now it's mainly concerned in packaging the basic
components such that all the hardware is fully useful.

Contributions welcome for the *other* softwarey bits of "Jupiter".
